# social-network-api

## Description
The goal of this challenge was to build the back end of a social network Api using MongoDB. I had to create the models using the format that mongo uses, which is very nice and not as finnicky as SQL is. i then created controllers for ease of use, and within each of those controllers is all the info needed to be passed into my Routes for Get, Post, Put, and Delete. Overall the challenge went pretty smoothly, besides me spending 4 hours trying to figure out why i couldnt access my endpoint in insomnia due to a missing set of parentheses.. This was a great learning experience to get some more experience with mongoDb, and learn how it functions more than i was aware of. All together i think i did pretty well on the assignment besides the few bugs that were eventually worked out. I made a video demonstating the functionality of all of my routes and endpoints and its linked below.
